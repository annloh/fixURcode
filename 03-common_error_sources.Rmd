# Most common error sources

In no particular order these are the most frequent reasons something goes 
wrong in my code:

- The object is of the wrong type (i.e. a matrix instead of a data.frame or the other way round)
- The object should have names but doesn't.
- I forgot to turn of `stringsaAsFactors = TRUE` 
(Problem of the past with R 4.0).
- Some object does not exist (typo or silent error in earlier code).
- A `(`, `{`, `,`, `"`   is missing or misplaced.
- I copy & pasted code from the web and some weird special characters are used instead of the standard ones R would like
- An object from the environment is used instead of a function parameter.
- The object you are looking for is at a different level of a nested list.
- The method can't handle missing data.
- A namespace conflict calls the wrong function.  
- A package update broke some function.

> Tipp: 
When copy & pasting stuff paste it in a text editor first to 
avoid weird non-code symbols.
