# Read the documentation

Reading documentation is a learned skill. 
It doesn't come naturally and take a lot of time to master. 
This is not always the user's fault. 
Also writing documentation is a skill that not all package developers master equally well.

Try always looking for the following elements when reading documentations.

(1) What arguments does the function take?
(2) Which of those arguments have to be provided?
(3) If they don't have to be provided is the default what I want?
(4) Which object types and dimensions should the input have?
(5) Does the input have to be named?

If the documentation is unclear in these regards try inferring some of the 
information from examples or a package vignette.

If the information on a specific package is scarce. 
Try the github search to see it in action.
