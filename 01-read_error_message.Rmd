# Error messages

## Read the error message 

The very obvious first step when your code is not working:
Read the error message. If that does not help. *Read it again.*


### Decifer the error message

Asking yourself the following question can help decifer the error message:  

- What object is the error message referring to?  
- What property of the object might be causing the error?  
  Is the object   
  * ... missing?  
  * ... of the wrong type?  
  * ... the wrong size?  
  * ... wrong content?  
  * ... misspelled?   

## Google the error

Often you can also google the error. 
Eliminate the parts that seem unique to your own code (e.g. specific dimensions, object names,...)

>Pro Tip (for new or niche packages):  
If google won't find the error try *github*.
You might find the error in the package code or in a github issue.

## Nonfuctional code but no errors

### Raise warnings or messages to errors

You can turn warnings and messages into errors with the following code:  
`options(warn = 2)`

Promote messages to errors:  
`rlang::with_abort(f(), "message")`

### No visible warnings or messages  

If the malfunctioning code does not produce any errors or warnings, check the documentation to see whether some warnings or error messages are turned off by default.
Often this is some form of `print = FALSE`, `verbose = FALSE` or `silent = TRUE`.
