# Debugging strategies

## Isolate the problem

### Minimum working example
- Remove as much code as possible but have the problem still occurring. 
- Locate the source of the error.
- Change one thing at a time.

## Line-by-line debugging (Stepping through the code)
- Run the code line by line
- Manual version of `debug()`

## Rubber duck debugging
Talk yourself through the code. (Or explain it to your rubber duck.)


## Print debugging

The idea of print debugging is to print certain objects or object properties 
close to where you expect the error might occur.
Printing might show you that an object has different properties from what you 
would expect it to have or help you figure out in which iteration or with which seed something might break. 
This is a quick and dirty option to the more elaborate debugging tools `browser()` or using a break point.

## Logging

Similar to print debugging you might want to print a `message()` or `cat()`
or use a logger to record how far your code came.
Especially, when using a lot of loops it might be useful to know which iteration caused the error.
