# Getting frustrated?

- Are you trying the same thing for the third time?
- You can't remember which of the 20 open tabs you have already tried?
- Hitting your computer or cursing at the screen?
- Randomly changing stuff?
- Copy and paste cryptic code snippets from stack overflow?



- Take a deep breath!
- Remind yourself that computers are completely rational.
No one is out there to get you! There is a logical reason! 
It didn't just magically break!

- Be determined to understand the problem.
- Embrace the challenge and the learning experience!
- Take a break!
