# Ask a peer

Sometimes you are so entangled in your code that you can't see the forest for the trees.
What has kept you stuck for days can often be solved within minutes by a fresh pair of eyes.
And even if the peer can't sove your problem; 
the process of walking them through it might make you come up with a solution yourself.
