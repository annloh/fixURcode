# Use Git!

- Create a bugfix branch (or two or three if you try more complex approaches)
- You can easily get back to your starting point
- Consider keeping the branch with a failed attempt it might be close to the truth
- You don't create new problems by forgetting to change something back in some remote part of the code that turned out to not work

- You can keep track of what you already tried
- If an attempt almost got you there and you discover the one thing that was 
missing three hours later you can easily recreate that "95% good" state
- When you fixed the problem, you can analyse the solution by looking at what exactly was changed
